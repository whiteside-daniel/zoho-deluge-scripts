//this deluge function will find all Deals which are related to an account, 
//and display them in a custom related list.Custom Related Lists are built 
//with a deluge function that returns XML. The CRM engine renders the XML 
//in the UI as if it were a related list like any other. The Related List
//is generated whenever you scroll far enough down the record that 
//part of the page begins to load... it's at this moment CRM will call the
//function which renders the XML for the custom related list.

//Step 1. Go to the Accounts module and visit any account. On the left tab, 
//click "Add Related List" and then choose the "Function" option
//
//Step 2. Create a new function and paste the code below into the function editor
string createXMLCustomRelatedList(String accountId)
