# Zoho Deluge Scripts
This package contains Zoho Deluge scripts for CRM, Desk, Creator, SalesIQ etc.

## About Deluge Code
Deluge is a scripting language specifically for use with Zoho products like CRM, Desk, SalesIQ, and Creator. Deluge's syntax is similar to JavaScript so the files here are named with .js filetype for GitHub to recognize common formatting and styling. This code is not ordinary JavaScript and will not run in a standalone JS engine/environment. See https://deluge.zoho.com/help/ for more information.

The folders of this project correspond to Zoho applications like CRM, Desk, SalesIQ, and so on. Each folder contains scripts that were meant to deploy from within that application (all scripts in the sales-iq folder, for example, are actually Plugs meant to be used inside of Zoho SalesIQ). 

## About the Catalyst Folder
Zoho Catalyst is a cloud-based development pipline and Devops tool allowing automated deployments and cloud services. The Catalyst folder contains sample projects which have been built on the Catalyst platform to integrate with other Zoho applications efficiently. These scripts are NOT written with Deluge but rather a combination of Node.js, HTML, and ordinary Javascript. One of the projects must be initialized with React libraries as well, so be aware of the initial configuration required for such an application. Please refer to https://docs.catalyst.zoho.com/ for more information about Zoho Catalyst.
